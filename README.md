# FactGrid-Cuneiform-Lib
The FactGrid Secondary Sources provides search functionality for a repository of ancient Near Eastern scholarly works, encompassing both serialized and monographic publications, scholarly journals, festschrifts, and dissertations, whether accessible online or offline. This initiative constitutes our endeavor to establish a mobile library dedicated to the ancient Near East, operating autonomously of institutional affiliations. Currently underway, the project aims to interconnect with primary sources and diverse assertions cited in the FactGrid Cuneiform Project.
